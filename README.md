Keyboard path optimisation algorithm.


Algorithmic Efficiency Optimisation System


Overview

This project develops an algorithmic solution to determine the minimum sequence of operations required to type a given string across multiple keyboard configurations.
The program evaluates alternative input strategies and dynamically selects the most efficient path to minimise total operations.


Key Features

Comparative evaluation of multiple keyboard layouts
Decision-making logic to optimise operation count
Algorithmic minimisation of user actions
Performance-focused structured implementation


Technical Concepts Applied

Algorithm design and optimisation
Decision-tree evaluation
Complexity awareness
Structured problem solving
Modular programming design


Technologies Used

Python


Example Scenario

Given a target string, the program:
Evaluates available keyboard configurations
Computes the required number of operations
Selects the optimal strategy
Outputs the most efficient sequence of actions


Learning Outcomes

This project enhanced my ability to design optimisation algorithms, analyse performance trade-offs, and implement structured decision-making logic.
